## Getting Started
The Investing Algorithm Framework is a Python framework for developing and backtesting investing algorithms.
For advanced Python users, a lot of the information you find in our documentation is self-explanatory. 

You might also want to check the [quick start guide](/blog/how-to-create-a-trading-bot-in-5-steps) directly which 
outlines the fundamentals of creating a simple trading bot.

After that, you can read the [basics](/docs/Getting%20Started/application-setup.md) to learn more about the framework.

## What you'll need
- [python 3 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Installation
You can install the framework using the following command:

```bash
pip install investing-algorithm-framework
```
